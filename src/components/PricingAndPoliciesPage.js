        I like to keep my photography sessions client-focused, collaborative,
        and flexible. I believe the best pictures are made when they highlight
        what makes you, you. I donâ€™t believe in forcing my vision onto the
        subject, but working with you to make something that you will love! All
        sessions come with my own provided poses and guidance, but I encourage
        you to bring your own poses, inside jokes, or props if you desire!
